                        <h3>What is SSL?</h3>
                        <p>
                            SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a technology that keeps your internet connection secure by 
                            encrypting data sent between your browser and a website. This prevents hackers from stealing 
                            sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What is TLS?</h3>
                        <p>
                            TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the newer, more secure version of SSL. While we still
                            say "SSL" in casual terms, modern websites actually use TLS to protect your data.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Look for a padlock icon in the address bar of your browser and make sure the website's URL 
                            starts with https://. These are signs that the website is using SSL/TLS encryption.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What does it mean to be secure?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being secure means that the data you send to and receive from a website is encrypted, 
                            making it hard for hackers to intercept or read it.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    
                    <li>
                        <h3>What is encryption and why do I care?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Encryption scrambles your data so only the intended recipient can understand it. 
                            You care because it protects your sensitive information (like passwords or payment details) 
                            from being stolen.
                        </p>                  
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>What is encryption and why do I care?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Encryption scrambles your data so only the intended recipient can understand it. 
                            You care because it protects your sensitive information (like passwords or payment details) 
                            from being stolen.
                        </p>
                    </li>
  
                    <li>
                        <h3>Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure websites?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes! HTTP is not secure, meaning your data can be intercepted. HTTPS is secure and 
                            uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect your information.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                                       
                    <li>
                        <h3>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h3>
                        <p>
                            An SSL certificate authority (CA) is a trusted organization that issues SSL certificates to 
                            websites. These certificates prove that a website is legitimate and secure.
                        </p>                       
                    </li>
